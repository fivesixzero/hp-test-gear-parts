OpenSCAD scripts for generation of parts for HP test gear along STL models of customized parts I've used in my lab

## Parts Available

### Front Panel Trim

All of these trim parts have dimensions that can be easily tuned in OpenSCAD to provide a precise fit for whatever device you're working with. This can be useful since there are subtle differences socket spacing and clearance requirements that can vary quite a bit, even within the same model.

#### **Top Trim, 1/4 Frame (HP PN: `5040-7204` / `5041-8804`)**

Customized to fit late-70's `59303A` HPIB DAC and will probably fit `59991A` phase comparator as well as other 1/4-frame devices.

This model can be generated as a two-part model ideal for FDM printing or as a single-part model for SLA printers or machining.

#### **Side Trim, 3.5" (HP PN: `5001-0438` / `5001-0538`)**

**`6644A`** variant is verified to fit `6644A` power supply, `5328A` counter, and `11713A` HPIB relay controller and possibly most other HP devices.
